[color=#ff0000]YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE TO PLAY ON Hippie Station. ANY USER SUSPECTED OF BEING UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE BANNED UNTIL THEY ARE OF AGE.[/color]

[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]1.[/color] Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay (ERP) or sexual content, including direct or indirect mentions of sexual behavior or actions.

[color=#a4885c]2.[/color] Don't communicate in-game/in-character information through methods outside of the game (such as talking in Discord with other users actively playing or by talking to your sibling across the room while you are both playing). This is referred to as "Metacomming" and we are not able to police it, therefore it is strictly forbidden.

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]3.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt the round/server. This includes autoclickers and auto-hotkey scripts.

[color=#a4885c]4.[/color] Don't "multi-key" (utilize multiple alt accounts). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#ff0000]IN GAME & ROLEPLAY RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]5.[/color] Don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.
    - Do not intentionally make other players' lives hell for your own amusement.
    - Antagonists have lots of leeway with this rule and may kill/sabotage as they see fit, but if it degrades the experience for majority of the rest of the server you will be told to stop.
    - [color=#ff0000]THE ROUND IS NOT OVER UNTIL THE END-ROUND SUMMARY APPEARS. KILLING SOMEONE FOR NO REASON BEFORE THIS WILL BE HANDLED ACCORDINGLY.[/color]

[color=#a4885c]6.[/color] Don't harass or target players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game (this is referred to as "Metagrudging".)
    - Annoying players for IC reasons in the current round is fine; doing it across rounds or as a ghost role after they kill you is not.

[color=#a4885c]7.[/color] Don't use information gained from outside your character's knowledge to gain an advantage (this is referred to as "Metagaming").
    - Using information you gain from outside your own character (such as spectating while a ghost, through screenshots or metacomms, or other means) to your advantage is strictly forbidden. You remember all events up until you fall unconscious, even after cloning. If you take a ghost role, unless otherwise stated, you DO NOT REMEMBER ANYTHING from your past life.

[color=#a4885c]8.[/color] Follow escalation rules and don't murder someone for slipping you, use common sense.
    - You can defend yourself to the extent of protecting your own life.
    - Security is unique in escalation and can escalate to less lethal to arrest criminals as needed.

[color=#a4885c]9.[/color] Don't immediately ghost or suicide from your role if you do not get antagonist (referred to as "Antag-rolling").
    - This is not fair to other players actually waiting patiently for an antagonist round. Alternatively, if you do not want to play an antagonist or do not want to cause conflict, do not opt-in for antagonist roles.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Intentionally making yourself a major problem/annoyance/disruption for the crew or other players at large while not an antagonist is forbidden (referred to as "self-antagging").

[color=#ff0000]SECURITY & COMMAND RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] If you sign up for a Command role, you are expected to know the basics of the game, your job, and the job(s) you supervise, if any.

	-Security/Command will be expected to answer for use of lethal force.
    -Security/Command will be expected to effect arrests on criminals and prevent them from dying while in custody, even if lethal force is used,
    unless there is strong reason to believe the criminal is an antagonist. Security/Command is strongly encouraged, but not required, to clone antagonists and effect a permabrigging or other sentence as deemed appropriate.

[color=#a4885c]12.[/color] Security/Command are expected to protect detainees in their custody to the best of their ability so as long as it does not come to unreasonable risk to themselves, the crew or the station at large to do so.

    -Brig times should generally not exceed 10 minutes. Repeat offenders or antagonists may be permabrigged.
