Space Station 14 is a multiplayer sandbox that has a heavy focus on player interaction. In the year 2557, the megacorporation Nanotrasen has employed
you as a staff member onboard their latest state of the art research station. Nanotrasen claims to be researching plasma, a mysterious new substance,
but rumors are abound that the station is little more than a twisted social experiment...

Players are assigned a role onboard the station - from a scientist performing research and development of new technologies, to a lowly janitor,
there's a ton of interesting ways to play. More importantly than assigning jobs, the game also randomly chooses a round type. Ranging from an all out
assault on the station by nuclear operatives, a sinister cult sacrificing crewmembers to summon their god, or just some good ol' fashioned traitors,
every round on Space Station 14 is different.
