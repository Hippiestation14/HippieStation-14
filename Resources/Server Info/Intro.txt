Before getting into anything else, it's important to note that since SS14 is such an open ended game that has other people in it, when you get in game and try to follow the guide,things may go wrong - the station might have been almost entirely consumed by asingularity, a traitor could attack you with a powerful weapon, or something no one couldhave predicted will kill you.
